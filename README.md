## 📝 About Me  
Outside of tech, I’m passionate about staying active — whether that’s lifting in the gym, running, or playing basketball (my favorite sport). I also enjoy cooking, especially perfecting a great steak. This past summer, I had the chance to study abroad in **Barcelona**, which gave me a global perspective and a deeper appreciation for learning through new experiences.
